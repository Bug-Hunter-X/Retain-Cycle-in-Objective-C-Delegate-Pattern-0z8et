To fix this, use a `weak` reference in the delegate property of object (B). This breaks the retain cycle, allowing both objects to be deallocated correctly when appropriate.  Here's how you'd modify object (B)'s declaration:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyDelegateProtocol> delegate;
```

By declaring the `delegate` property as `weak`, object (B) no longer retains its delegate (A).  Object (A) still holds a strong reference to (B), but since (B) no longer strongly references (A) through the delegate, the retain cycle is broken.  Make sure your `MyDelegateProtocol` is correctly defined to specify the methods (B) will call on its delegate (A).  Using `weak` where appropriate is crucial for avoiding retain cycles and maintaining efficient memory management in Objective-C.
