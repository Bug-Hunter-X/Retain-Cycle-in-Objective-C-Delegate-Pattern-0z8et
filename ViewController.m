In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and object lifetimes, specifically with regards to delegate patterns and strong references.  Consider this scenario: a view controller (A) sets itself as the delegate of another object (B).  If (A) holds a strong reference to (B) and (B) holds a strong reference back to (A) (through the delegate property), a retain cycle is created.  This prevents either object from being deallocated, even after they're no longer needed, leading to memory leaks and potential crashes.
